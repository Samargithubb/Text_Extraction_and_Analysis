# Text_Extraction_and_Analysis
## In this assignment, I successfully accomplished the following tasks:

## Data Extraction

Extracted textual data from articles provided in the "input.xlsx" file.
Ensured that only the article title and text were extracted, excluding any irrelevant content like website headers and footers.
Utilized Python programming, specifically leveraging libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, TextBlob, nltk or pandas  for efficient data extraction.

## Data Analysis

#### Conducted text analysis on each of the extracted articles.
#### Computed various textual variables, as outlined in the "Text Analysis.ipynb" file. These variables included:
- POSITIVE SCORE
- NEGATIVE SCORE
- POLARITY SCORE
- SUBJECTIVITY SCORE
- AVG SENTENCE LENGTH
- PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS
- FOG INDEX
- AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE
- COMPLEX WORD COUNT
- WORD COUNT
- SYLLABLES PER WORD
- PERSONAL PRONOUNS
- AVG WORD LENGTH
  
#### Ensured that the output was formatted precisely as specified in the "Output Data Structure.xlsx" file.
#### Employed Python programming for efficient and accurate data analysis.

### In summary, the benefit of this analysis lies in its ability to extract actionable information from textual data, facilitating better decision-making, content optimization, and improved understanding of the content's characteristics.
